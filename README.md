# HardcoreSurvival
Plugin Fran√ßais qui rend les survies hardcores en multijoueur plus sympathique :p

----------------------------
Hardcore Survival is a plugin meant to make your multiplayer hardcore survival much more better !

You may not make your server as hardcore if you enable this plugin on the server, the plugin already simulate the hardcore behaviour

The plugin adds several features such as:

- Reviving players using Totems of undying that you drop on their grave
- Craft of the Bad Omen Potion to farm totems
- A /sacrifice command that can saves your friends by spawning a totem of undying
- tp command for dead players without any permission to configure
- Many configurable features in config.yml

The craft of the bad omen potion is a shapeless recipe that requires:
fermented spider eye, magma cream, ghast tear, netherite ingot, gunpowder, bone, rotten flesh, eye of ender and a bottle
But you can change the needed materials in config.yml if you don't like those

Commands and permissions:
(<> means the argument must appear / [] means the argument is optional)

- /revive <player> (hardcore.revive) allows you to revive a player without totem

- /sacrifice (no permission) sacrifice yourself for a totem of undying, watch out, your inventory will be lost in the process !

- /tpto <player> (no permission) teleports to a player when you are dead

- /start [player] (hardcore.start) makes all players (or specific players) starts in the differents 4 corners of the map that you can define in config.yml

- /hardcorereload (hardcore.reload) makes you reload the config.yml


In the config.yml generated by the plugin, you will be guided throughout your modifications.

If you are having some troubleshooting reviving someone, make sure that you drop the totem of undying on the soul sand block that is the nearest from the stone brick

Hope you will have fun ! If you have some issues, feel free to post them in the issues page of this github ^^
